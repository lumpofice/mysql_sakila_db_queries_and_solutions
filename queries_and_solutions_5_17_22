1) result set: customer_id, num_action_rentals, category = 'ACTION';
We rtrive the customer_id and the number rentals such that 'ACTION' is the category type for each rental.
------------code------------------
SELECT r.customer_id AS customer_id, count(r.rental_id) AS num_action_rentals, ca.name AS type FROM rental AS r
INNER JOIN inventory AS i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id INNER JOIN film_category AS fc ON i.film_id = fc.film_id 
INNER JOIN category AS ca ON fc.category_id = ca.category_id WHERE ca.name = 'ACTION' GROUP BY r.customer_id;

2) result set: film title, category name, number of films in each category; We retrieve the title of each film, 
the category of that film, and the number of films in each category. 
-----------code-----------------
SELECT f.title, c.name, count.count_of_category FROM film AS f INNER JOIN film_category AS fc ON 
f.film_id = fc.film_id INNER JOIN category AS c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id INNER JOIN (SELECT count(*)
AS count_of_category, category_id FROM film_category GROUP BY category_id) AS count ON 
c.category_id = count.category_id;

3) result set: avg_payment_amount, customer_first_name, customer_last_name; We retrieve average payment for each 
customer, as well as each customer's name.
------------code----------------
SELECT avg(p.amount) AS avg_payment_amount, c.first_name, c.last_name FROM customer AS c INNER JOIN payment AS p 
ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id GROUP BY c.customer_id;

4) result set: payment amount, customer id, average payment per customer; We retrieve each amount paid by the customer,
the customer's id, and the average amount paid by this customer over the lifetime of their active membership.
----------code-----------------
SELECT p.amount, c.customer_id, averag.cust_averag FROM payment AS p INNER JOIN customer AS c ON 
p.customer_id = c.customer_id INNER JOIN (SELECT avg(amount) AS cust_averag, customer_id FROM payment GROUP BY 
customer_id) AS averag ON c.customer_id = averag.customer_id;

5) result set: for each customer, a list of payment amounts such that each payment amount is greater than average 
payment for the customer, each customer's id, average payment of each customer; We retrieve each amount paid by 
the customer, on condition that the amount is greater than the customer's average, we retrieve the customer's id,
and we retrieve the average amount paid by the customer over the lifetime of their active membership.
-------------code--------------
SELECT p.amount, c.customer_id, averag.cust_averag FROM payment AS p INNER JOIN customer AS c ON 
p.customer_id = c.customer_id INNER JOIN (SELECT avg(amount) AS cust_averag, customer_id FROM payment GROUP BY 
customer_id) AS averag ON c.customer_id = averag.customer_id WHERE p.amount > averag.cust_averag;
