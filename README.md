# This is a repository holding MySQL queries and their solutions for the sakila database. 

 - I have not been able to find a rich source of such things in my cursory glance into the usual places for such material. Thus, this repository will serve as a bank of exercises and their solutions. 

 - I have provided queries, babysteps to these queries, necessary checks leading up to these queries, and observations about these queries. 

 - Finally, there is a python script used to display table form solutions to these queries, baby steps, observations, alternatives, etc.  

<b>sakila_queries_solutions_1.sql<\b>
 - Has queries for the sakila database

<b>sakila_queries_solutions_2.sql<\b>
 - Has somewhat more involved queries for the sakila database
