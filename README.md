# This is a repository holding MySQL queries and their solutions for the sakila database. 

 - I have not been able to find a rich source of such things in my cursory glance into the usual places for such material. Thus, this repository will serve as a bank of exercises and their solutions. 

 - I have provided queries as QUERY, their solutions, baby steps towards such solutions in the form of BABY STEP i, where i is a natural number, and solutions to these baby steps. 

 - Finally, there is a python script used to display table form solutions to these queries, baby steps, observations, alternatives, etc.
