**WARNING**
This repository is ongoing an is subject to change on any given day. What I hope to keep constant are the queries, give or take some columns. The solutions may be updated to reflect greater sophistication in my own (or a contributor's) understanding.

In fact, some of the solutions need to have corrections made to them. Possibly, the queries themselves need to be altered. 

This is a repository holding MySQL queries and their solutions. I have not been able to find a rich source of such things in my cursory glance into the usual places for such material. Thus, this repository will serve as a bank of exercises and their solutions.
