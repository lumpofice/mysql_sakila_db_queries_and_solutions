This is a repository holding MySQL queries and their solutions for the sakila database. I have not been able to find a rich source of such things in my cursory glance into the usual places for such material. Thus, this repository will serve as a bank of exercises and their solutions. I have provided queries as QUERY, their solutions, baby steps towards such solutions in the form of BABY STEP i, where i is a natural number, and solutions to these baby steps. Finally, there is a python script used to display table form solutions to these queries and baby steps. Query i) QUERY from the .sql file corresponds to table form solution queryi from .py file, and baby step BABY STEP j under query i) QUERY in the .sql file corresponds with table form solution queryi_babystepj in the .py file.
